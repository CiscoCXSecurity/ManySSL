MANYSSL(1)                                                                      User Contributed Perl Documentation                                                                      

DESCRIPTION
       This perl script will enumerate the SSL ciphers in use on any SSL encrypted service, including STARTTLS on SMTP.  The script will warn the operator if a self 
       signed certificate is detected on a https encrypted service.

USAGE
       Usage:  ./manyssl1.2.pl [-h] [-f targets_file] [-m] [-s ip -p port] [-t timeout(secs)] [-c 128]

               [-h]            this help message
               [-f]            accept a file denoting targets, in the form ip:port
               [-m]            servers are a mailserver; perform starttls
               [-s]            server ip. Accepted forms: single ip 192.168.0.1 or range 192.168.0.1-254 or comma delimited 192.168.0.1,192.168.1.2
               [-p]            port number of ssl service
               [-c 128]        only display ciphers with a key length under 128 bits
               [-r]            Highlight weak ciphers in the color "RED"
               [-t timeout]    alter the timeout value in seconds (default 10 secs)

UPDATING 
       update: ./manyssl.pl -u updates the cipher DB through openssl

WHATS NEW

2008-11-11

2008-09-03
       Corrected the following error(s):
       * Validation of SSL certificates (code would fail if first cipher in cipher list was not accepted)
2008-08-22
       Improved the following:
       * Validation of SSL certificates
       * Checks expiration date of Certificates
